# EX 3A Knight Tour & Count Path
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a python program to find minimum steps to reach to specific cell in minimum moves by knight


## Algorithm
1. Define the Knightâ€™s Moves: A knight has 8 possible moves from a given position.

2. Start from the source cell.

3. Use a queue to explore positions level by level.

4. Mark visited positions to avoid cycles.

5. Count steps until the target is reached.

6. If target is reached, return the number of steps.

```python
class cell:
     
    def __init__(self, x = 0, y = 0, dist = 0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.dist = dist

def isInside(x, y, N):
    if (x >= 1 and x <= N and
        y >= 1 and y <= N):
        return True
    return False
def minStepToReachTarget(knightpos,
                         targetpos, N):
    # add your code here
    #Start here
    dx = [2, 2, -2, -2, 1, 1, -1, -1]
    dy = [1, -1, 1, -1, 2, -2, 2, -2]
    queue = []
    queue.append(cell(knightpos[0], knightpos[1], 0))
    visited = [[False for i in range(N + 1)] for j in range(N + 1)]
    visited[knightpos[0]][knightpos[1]] = True
    while(len(queue) > 0):
        t = queue[0]
        queue.pop(0)
        if(t.x == targetpos[0] and
           t.y == targetpos[1]):
            return t.dist
        for i in range(8):
            x = t.x + dx[i]
            y = t.y + dy[i]
            if(isInside(x, y, N) and not visited[x][y]):
                visited[x][y] = True
                queue.append(cell(x, y, t.dist + 1))
    #End here
if __name__=='__main__':
    N = 30
    knightpos = [1, 1]
    targetpos = [30, 30]
    print(minStepToReachTarget(knightpos,
                               targetpos, N))

```

## Result:
The program executed successfully, and the minimum number of steps for the knight to reach the target was calculated.
